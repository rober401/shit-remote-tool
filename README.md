# shit-remote-tool
Basic its not good, I didn't put effort as I should have but you and still use it to launch a remote access tool / like activation of SSH or telnet then login to your targets computer 


When connected type alive to see if target is still alive -- still lots of errors
If you change the code I would love to see how better you made it :D / cuz its pretty simple , 

I was going to fix the return 0 by making it into a string and stuff but I forgot
